/**
 * Factory Design Patterns
 * 
 *  The Factory functions is similar to the constructor functions/class functions, but instead of using the new keyword to create an object,
 *  factory functions creates an bject and returns it. They do not require the use of this keyword to access inner values. 
 * 
 *  It always returns an object.
 *  
 *  Why is it useful?
 *  If we have complex logic, and we have to create multiple objects again and again that have the same logic, we can write the logic once
 *  in a function and use that function as a factory to create our objects. Itâ€™s exactly the same as a real-world factory producing products.
 */

// There is a difference between Factory functions and Factory Method.

/**
 *  Factory Method Pattern
 *  Note: Look up the keyword "mixins" --> allows us to reuse code
 *  Falls heavily on classes
 * 
 * @description - It aims to provide a solution for creating objects without specifying the exact class of the object that is created.
